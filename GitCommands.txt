Version Control System
===============================
Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.

Listed below are the functions of a VCS -

Allows developers to work simultaneously.
Does not allow overwriting each other�s changes.
Maintains a history of every version.

Following are the types of VCS -
Centralized version control system (CVCS).
Distributed/Decentralized version control system (DVCS).  git hub

========================================================
Distributed Version Control System
Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team 
collaboration. 
But the major drawback of CVCS is its single point of failure, i.e., failure of the central server. 
Unfortunately, if the central server goes down for an hour, then during that hour, no one can collaborate at 
all. And even in a worst case, if the disk of the central server gets corrupted and proper backup has not been taken, then you will lose the entire history of the project. Here, distributed version control system (DVCS) comes into picture.

DVCS clients not only check out the latest snapshot of the directory but they also fully mirror the repository.
If the server goes down, then the repository from any client can be copied back to the server to restore it.
Every checkout is a full backup of the repository. Git does not rely on the central server and that is 
why you can perform many operations when you are offline. 
You can commit changes, create branches, view logs, and perform other operations when you are offline. 
You require network connection only to publish your changes and take the latest changes.

==================
Features:
Free and open source
Fast and small
Implicit backup
Security
====================================
DVCS Terminologies
Local Repository
Every VCS tool provides a private workplace as a working copy. Developers make changes in their private 
workplace and after commit, these changes become a part of the repository.

Working Directory and Staging Area or Index
The working directory is the place where files are checked out. In other CVCS, developers generally make
 modifications and commit their changes directly to the repository. 
But Git uses a different strategy. Git doesn�t track each and every modified file. Whenever you do commit an operation, Git looks for the files present in the staging area. Only those files present in the staging area are considered for commit and not all the modified files.

Let us see the basic workflow of Git.

Step 1 - You modify a file from the working directory.

Step 2 - You add these files to the staging area.

Step 3 - You perform commit operation that moves the files from the staging area. After push operation,
 it stores the changes permanently to the Git repository.

How to Install Git on Windows
1.To use Git, you have to install it on your computer. Even if you have already installed Git, 
it's probably a good idea to upgrade it to the latest version. 
You can either install it as a package or via another installer or download it from its official site.
Click on the package given on the page as download 2.23.0 for windows.

2.Click on the downloaded installer file and select yes to continue

Now the question arises that how to download the Git installer package. Below is the stepwise installation process that helps you to download and install the Git.

How to download Git?
Step1


To download the Git installer, visit the Git's official site and go to download page. The link for the download page is https://git-scm.com/downloads

-git init
-git add
-Git Clone
---------
In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository to create a local copy on your system.
$ git clone https://github.com/Manisha-atos/DevOps5Jan.git --current dirctory
$ git clone https://github.com/Manisha-atos/DevOps5Jan.git "sample"--  to sample folder
-Git Clone Branch
---------------
Git allows making a copy of only a particular branch from a repository.
$ git clone -b feature/new-feature  https://github.com/Manisha-atos/DevOps5Jan.git "branch"
-Git Stash
--------
Sometimes you want to switch the branches, but you are working on an incomplete part of your current project. You don't want to make a commit of half-done work. Git stashing allows you to do so. The git stash command enables you to switch branches without committing the current branch.
$git status
$git stash
$git stash list
git index
$git status
As we mentioned earlier index is a file, not a directory, 
So Git is not storing objects into it. 
Instead, it stores information about each file in our repository. This information could be:

mtime: It is the time of the last update.
file: It is the name of the file.
Wdir: The version of the file in the working directory.
Stage: The version of the file in the index.
Repo: The version of the file in the repository.

Git Head
The HEAD points out the last commit in the current checkout branch. 
It is like a pointer to any reference. The HEAD can be understood as the "current branch." When you switch branches with 'checkout,' the HEAD is transferred to the new branch.
$git show head
$git log
$git show 76f9a8cd9aa75948b22a9847d8c863c06d292f03




git commit

==================================================================================
Add and Commit
----------------
create  a file in Myprojct
example File1.txt
add some text in  it
Now save the changes in staging error

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git add File1.txt


will add the File1.txt to staging Area.

To add all files in the staging error use
git em --cached File1.txt

git commit -m "First Commit"

(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

-----------------------------------------------------
Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git add .
.-->Period 

$git add File*

To commit the files in Local Repository
---------------------------------------
Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git commit -m "First Commit"
[master (root-commit) 1aef2b1] First Commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 File1.txt

Git commit
The above command will prompt a default editor and ask for a commit message.
Press the Esc key and after that 'I' for insert mode. Type a commit message whatever you want.
Press Esc after that ':wq' to save and exit from the editor. Hence, we have successfully made a commit.

Git commit -a 
The commit command also provides -a option to specify some commits. It is used to commit the snapshots
of all changes. This option only consider already added files in Git.

Git commit -m "First commit"

The -m option of commit command lets you to write the commit message on the command line.
This command will not prompt the text editor.


git commit -am "Third Commit"


===========================Inspecting &Tracking commands=========================
git status
git log
git diff

git History
How to view Git Commit History of specific intervals?
It is a self-explanatory option in git log. When we type the command:
git log �since=<date>

Diff command is used in git to track the difference between the changes made on a file. show the diffe between old and new content.
============================================================

To check the status 
--------------------
Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean


Now do some changes in files 
add the files to staging area and check the status

example :do changes in File2

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git add .

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   File2.txt

===========================Config Command =====================================================
configure the user who will use the local repository by setting name and email 
Git Config command can run globally or in  the current directory

Create a new user:
$ git config --global user.name "Manisha Mane"
git config --global user.email  "pimplemp@rediffmail.com"

Or locally
$ git config  user.name "Manisha Mane"
git config  user.email  "pimplemp@rediffmail.com"


$git config --list
This command will list all your settings. See the below command line output.

===================Cloning========================

In Git, cloning is the act of making a copy of any target repository. 
The target repository can be remote or local. You can clone your repository from the remote repository 
to create a local copy on your system. Also, you can sync between the two locations.
$ git clone https://github.com/Manisha-atos/NewRepo.git 

========================Undoing changes===================
Git Checkout
In Git, the term checkout is used for the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command is used to switch between branches in a repository

Git Revert
In Git, the term revert is used to revert some changes.Git revert allows some additional operations like editing, no editing, cleanup, and more. Let's understand these options briefly:

$ git revert 76f9a8cd9aa75948b22a9847d8c863c06d292f03
< commit>: The commit option is used to revert a commit. To revert a commit, we need the commit reference id. The git log command can access it.

$ git revert <commit-ish>  
<--edit>: It is used to edit the commit message before reverting the commit. It is a default option in git revert command.

$ git revert -e <commit-ish>  
-m parent-number /--mainline parent-number: it is used to revert the merging. Generally, we cannot revert a merge because we do not know which side of the merge should be considered as the mainline. We can specify the parent number and allows revert to reverse the change relative to the specified parent.

-n/--no edit: This option will not open a text editor. It will directly revert the last commit.

$ git revert -n <commit-ish>  
--cleanup=<mode>: The cleanup option determines how to strip spaces and comments from the message.

$git reset

Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit. ... Contrast this with git reset , which does alter the existing commit history. For this reason, git revert should be used to undo changes on a public branch, and git reset should be reserved for undoing changes on a private branch.


=======================Branching =======================

git branch:


Branch --another line of development.
default is the Master Branch .
we can create a duplicate copy of current branch do the new changes
and then update the original branch

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git status
On branch master

New Develop Branch is created 

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/ManishaGit/Myprojct (master)
$ git branch develop

====================
Check your Remote
To check the configuration of the remote server, run the git remote command. The git remote command allows accessing the connection between remote and local. If you want to see the original existence of your cloned repository, use the git remote command. It can be used as:

Git Environment Setup
The environment of any tool consists of elements that support execution with software, hardware, and network configured. It includes operating system settings, hardware configuration, software configuration, test terminals, and other support to perform the operations. It is an essential aspect of any software.

It will help you to understand how to set up Git for first use on various platforms so you can read and write code in no time.


You can customize your Git output to view a personalized color theme. The git config can be used to set these color themes.

Color.ui

$ Git config -global color.ui true  
The default value of color.ui is set as auto, which will apply colors to the immediate terminal output stream. You can set the color value as true, false, auto, and always.

Git configuration levels
-------------------------
The git config command can accept arguments to specify the configuration level. The following configuration levels are available in the Git config.
local--default configuration
global
system

============================== git tags==========================
How To add a Tag In Git?
1.Open Git Bash in the working directory.

2. Check if you have a clean working directory.

3. Execute the following command to view the commits:

git log �oneline

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/2021/January/GitRSS12Jan/day1 (master)
$ git log --oneline
76f9a8c (HEAD -> master) new commit
19b6bc1 (tag: ongoing, origin/master) commit
ba9b4c7 (origin/feature/new-feature) tues commit4


4.We can now create a tag onto any of these commits. 
Let�s tag the last commit on the dev branch by executing the following command:

git tag ongoing dev
5. to tag a specific commit

Dell@Admin MINGW64 /g/2021/January/GitRSS12Jan/day1 (master)
$ git log --oneline
76f9a8c (HEAD -> master) new commit
19b6bc1 (tag: ongoing, origin/master) commit
